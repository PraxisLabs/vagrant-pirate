# All Vagrant VM configuration can be done from Yaml config files such as this
# one. Only config files in the 'enabled.d' directory are interpreted. You
# can copy from, or symlink to, files in the 'available.d' directory. This
# allows you to have a library of config files that could, for example, be
# updated by an external application.

# Also, any Yaml config file in local.d/ named the same as one in enabled.d/
# will allow the selective override of individual configuration settings. See
# local.d/vm1.yaml for an example.

# To see what you can do with Yaml, check out this handy reference card:
# http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html. To see how Yaml is interpreted in Ruby, see
# this guide: http://yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html. For further details, refer to
# the full Yaml specification: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

# For all available Vagrant options, see the docs on Vagrantfile settings:
# http://vagrantup.com/v2/docs/vagrantfile.html. While we've provided some
# examples below, it's far from exhaustive. If you can't figure out how to
# apply a particular setting, please file a support request at:
# https://github.com/PraxisLabs/vagrant-yaml. Also, feel free to post to the
# project's wiki, or submit pull requests.
