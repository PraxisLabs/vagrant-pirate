Feature: Init command

  In order to start using a YAML-based Vagrant project
  As a user using vagrant-pirate
  I want to initialize a new project

  Scenario: Running 'vagrant pirate ship'
    Given a directory named "test"
    And I cd to "test"
    When I successfully run `vagrant pirate ship`
    Then the following directories should exist:
      | local.d |
      | available.d |
      | enabled.d |
    And the following files should exist:
      | Vagrantfile |
      | available.d/default.yaml |
      | enabled.d/vm1.yaml |
      | enabled.d/vm2.yaml |
      | local.d/vm1.yaml |
      | local.d/vm2.yaml |
    And the output should contain "A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory, a default Yaml VM config file"
    And the output should contain "has been placed in 'available.d', and a symlink to it, placed in 'enabled.d'."
    And the output should contain "Finally, a file to contain local overrides was placed in 'local.d'. Unlike a"
    And the output should contain "regular Vagrantfile, this one parses and applies the configuration in the Yaml"
    And the output should contain "files it finds in 'enabled.d'. You are now ready to `vagrant up` your first"
    And the output should contain "virtual environment! Please read the comments in the default Yaml VM config"
    And the output should contain "file to see how it works."
