              A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory, a default Yaml VM config file
              has been placed in /vms-available, and a symlink to it, placed in /vms-enabled.
              Unlike a regular Vagrantfile, this one parses and applies the configuration in
              the Yaml files it finds in /vms-enabled. You are now ready to `vagrant up` your
              first virtual environment! Please read the comments in the default Yaml VM
              config file to see how it works.
