              A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory, a default Yaml VM config file
              has been placed in vms-available/, and a symlink to it, placed in vms-enabled/.
              Finally, a file to contain local overrides was placed in local.d/. Unlike a
              regular Vagrantfile, this one parses and applies the configuration in the Yaml
              files it finds in vms-enabled/. You are now ready to `vagrant up` your first
              virtual environment! Please read the comments in the default Yaml VM config
              file to see how it works.
          update:
            success: |-
              Vagrantfile updated using the latest one from vagrant-yaml.
            confirmation: |-
              This operation will overwrite the Vagrantfile in this project with the one in the
              vagrant-yaml gem. Do you want to proceed?
            will_not_update: |-
              User aborted. Vagrantfile was not updated.

        errors:
          vagrantfile_exists: |-
            `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before running `vagrant
            yaml init`, or run `vagrant yaml update` to update to the latest version.
