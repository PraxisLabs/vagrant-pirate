              A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. A default directory containing
              a Piratefile (Yaml VM config file) has been placed in '%{avail_dir}', and symlinks
              to it, placed in '%{enabled_dir}'. Finally, files to contain local overrides were
              placed in '%{local_dir}'. Unlike a regular Vagrantfile, this one parses and applies
              the configuration in the Piratefiles it finds under '%{enabled_dir}'. You are now
              ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read the comments in
              the default Yaml VM config file to see how it works.
          ship:
            success: |-
              A `Vagrantfile` and `Piratefile` (YAML VM config file) have been placed in this
              directory, along with a symlink to it (that defines the VM name). Unlike a regular
              Vagrantfile, this one parses and applies the configuration in the Piratefile. You
              are now ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read the
              comments in the Piratefile to see how it works.
          update:
            success: |-
              Vagrantfile updated using the latest one from vagrant-pirate.
            confirmation: |-
              This operation will overwrite the Vagrantfile in this project with the one in the
              vagrant-pirate gem. Do you want to proceed?
            will_not_update: |-
              User aborted. Vagrantfile was not updated.
